// Check accelerator routines called where they are not permitted due to their
// levels of parallelism.
//
// Additionally, because this test declares functions without routine
// directives, then separately defines them with routine directives, and then
// uses them on the accelerator, it checks that implicit routine directive
// analysis uses each function's most recent declaration.  In the past, when
// such a function was a member conversion operator (but this test covers many
// other kinds of functions, which could develop the same problem), Clang called
// its MarkFunctionReferenced with the original declaration of the operator,
// producing an assert fail in Clang's implicit routine directive analysis
// because it didn't consistently see the explicit routine directive from the
// most recent declaration.  Now, Clang's OpenACC analysis is careful to
// consistently look up the most recent declaration of any function that is
// passed to it from elsewhere.

// Include the the usee function definitions with their routine directives, and
// then include the users so it will complain about incompatible levels of
// parallelism (and not about late routine directives).
