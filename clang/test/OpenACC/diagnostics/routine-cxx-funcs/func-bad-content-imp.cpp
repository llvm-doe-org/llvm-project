// Check accelerator routines with implicit routine directives and contents that

// Our goal here isn't to check all kinds of uses that can imply a routine
// directive.  Testing for routine directives in C already thoroughly checks
// fundamental cases, and early-uses.cpp checks that various special C++
// usee/user relationship are generally seen by Clang's OpenACC analysis.
// Instead, the goal here is to make sure that various diagnostics that are
// recorded in the bodies of various special C++ functions are reported
// successfully later when the routine directives are implied.  ../routine.cpp
// checks various contexts in which routine directives can be implied.
