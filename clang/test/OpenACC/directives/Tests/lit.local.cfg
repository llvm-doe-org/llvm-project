# Overview of "clang/test/OpenACC/directives"
#
# See "../../README.md" for important documentation about the organization of
# this portion of Clang's OpenACC test suite.  See "../../lit.local.cfg" for the
# LIT configuration shared with the rest of Clang's OpenACC test suite.
#
# Within "clang/test/OpenACC/directives", all test appear in the "Tests"
# subdirectory.  That's actually configured for LIT as an excluded directory,
# but other subdirectories are symbolic links to "Tests" in order to effectively
# replicate every test as part of a different sub test suite:
#
# * "dump" runs checks from %acc-check-dmp[-cxx]{...} substitutions.
# * "print" runs checks from %acc-check-prt[-cxx]{...} substitutions.
# * "host" runs checks from %acc-check-exe[-cxx]*{...} substitutions and selects
#   no device types for offload compilation.
# * Each architecture-specific sub test suite ("x86_64-pc-linux-gnu",
#   "nvptx64-nvidia-cuda", etc.) runs checks from %acc-check-exe[-cxx]*{...}
#   substitutions and selects just the specified device type for offload
#   compilation.  All tests in the sub test suite are marked unsupported if that
#   device type is not available on the system.
# * The latter two are sometimes called "execution sub test suites" to indicate
#   they run checks from %acc-check-exe[-cxx]*{...} substitutions.
#
# For each sub test suite, its name is added to the LIT features that can be
# used in REQUIRES, UNSUPPORTED, and XFAIL.
#
# LIT substitutions are documented where they are defined below.  Their
# expansions often depend on the sub test suite.  For example, each of the
# above sub test suites suppresses checks from the %acc-check-*{...}
# substitutions associated with other sub test suites by adjusting their
# expansions.  To be clear, all "RUN:" directives execute as usual in LIT.  The
# only difference is how substitutions within them expand.
#
# %acc-check-*{...} substitutions without "-cxx" in the name should be used only
# in test files that are C.  %acc-check-*{...} substitutions with "-cxx" in the
# name should be used only in test files that are C++.
#...............................................................................
# %acc-check-*{...} general syntax
#
# The general syntax of each %acc-check-*{...} substitution is as follows:
# * For example:
#
#     // RUN: %acc-check-exe{clang-args: -DFOO=1; exe-args: 2}
#
#   This expands %acc-check-exe with the parameter "clang-args" set to
#   "-DFOO=1" and the parameter "exe-args" set to "2".
# * Each %acc-check-* is documented in more detail where it is defined below.
#   That documentation includes the formal parameter list.
# * Arguments must appear in the same order as in the formal parameter list.
#   That is, their names are required purely for readability and do not permit
#   them to be omitted or specified in a different order.  There's one
#   exception: an argument with an empty value can be omitted entirely
#   (including any preceding ";", the name, the ":", and the value) if all later
#   arguments are omitted entirely as well.
# * The braces enclosing the argument list cannot be omitted even if all
#   arguments are omitted.
# * Argument values cannot include any character in the set "{};".  As a result,
#   these substitutions cannot appear in each other's arguments.
# * A series of spaces is ignored if it immediately precedes (1) an argument
#   name, (2) the ":" following an argument name, (2) an argument value, or (3)
#   a ";".
# * To format an argument list across multiple lines, "\" must escape each
#   newline as usual in LIT.  For example:
#
#     // RUN: %acc-check-exe{                                                  \
#     // RUN:   clang-args: -DFOO=1;                                           \
#     // RUN:   exe-args:   2}
#
#   It's best not to move the closing "}" to the following line, where LIT might
#   mistake it for the closing "}" of a %for {...}.
# * If the syntax rules for a %acc-check-*{...} substitution are not obeyed, LIT
#   usually doesn't recognize the substitution and so doesn't expand it.
#   Usually the result is a shell error about an unknown command named something
#   like "%acc-check-exe".
#...............................................................................
# FileCheck prefixes and components
#
# Many of the %acc-check-*{...} substitutions execute FileCheck commands.
# FileCheck prefixes for these commands are built as follows:
# * Each %acc-check-*{...} expansion has (see individual documentation below):
#   * A predefined FileCheck prefix base.  For example:
#
#       PRT
#
#   * A predefined sequence of FileCheck prefix component sets that are included
#     or excluded based on the check being run.  For example:
#
#       set 1: NOACC,A,AO,O,OA
#       set 2: AST,SRC
#
#   * A final set of FileCheck prefix components specified by any "fc-pres"
#     argument to the %acc-check-*{...} substitution.  All of these components
#     are always included.
# * The FileCheck prefixes used are built by appending components to the prefix
#   base, with "-" separating components, as follows:
#   * Always use the prefix base by itself as a prefix.  For example:
#
#       PRT
#
#   * To the prefix base, append every included prefix component from the first
#     set.  For example, if -fopenacc-print=omp-acc is being checked, then
#     NOACC, A, and AO are excluded, but O and OA are included, so the prefixes
#     should be:
#
#       PRT,PRT-O,PRT-OA
#
#   * To each of the prefixes built so far, append every included prefix
#     component from the second set.  For example, because
#     -fopenacc-print=omp-acc is being checked, AST should be excluded, but SRC
#     should be included, so the prefixes should be:
#
#       PRT,PRT-O,PRT-OA,PRT-SRC,PRT-O-SRC,PRT-OA-SRC
#
#   * And so on, in the order of the predefined sets, and concluding with the
#     set from any "fc-pres" argument.
# * The result is a set of FileCheck prefixes that can be used to identify
#   the combination of conditions under which a FileCheck directive should be
#   enabled.  For example:
#   * Use "PRT" if the FileCheck directive should always be enabled for this
#     %acc-check-*{...} substitution's FileCheck commands.
#   * Use "PRT-OA" if the FileCheck directive should be enabled when checking
#     either -fopenacc-ast-print=omp-acc or -fopenacc-print=omp-acc.
#   * Use "PRT-OA-AST" if the FileCheck directive should be enabled only when
#     checking -fopenacc-ast-print=omp-acc.
#   * Notice that "PRT-AST-OA" is never included.  That is, prefix components
#     can be omitted from a prefix if they do not indicate desired conditions,
#     but they cannot be reordered.
#
# WARNING: Be conservative about adding new prefix components.  They can
# significantly increase test suite execution time.  See discussion of prefixes
# for %acc-check-exe[-cxx][-no-s2s]{...} for more details.
#...............................................................................
# Preprocessor definitions (-D)
#
# All Clang commands expanded from all %acc-check-*{...} substitutions in all
# sub test suites set each of the following preprocessor macros to 1 if the
# condition it indicates is true, and otherwise it leaves it undefined:
#
# * "TGT_HOST":
#   * Indicates compilation is only for host.
#   * This is true throughout the "dump", "print", and "host" sub test suites.
# * "TGT_" followed by the uppercase version of the omp_device_t spelling of an
#   architecture-specific device type:
#   * For example, "TGT_X86_64" or "TGT_NVPTX64".
#   * Indicates offload compilation for that device type.
#   * This is true throughout the associated architecture-specific sub test
#     suite.
# * "TGT_USE_STDIO":
#   * Indicates the device type selected for compilation supports stdio (e.g.,
#     "printf") in target regions.
#   * This is true throughout the "dump", "print", and "host" sub test suites.
#   * This is true in some architecture-specific sub test suites.
# * "EXE_S2S_AST_PRT":
#   * Indicates an execution sub test suite and either:
#     * Source-to-source mode with -fopenacc-ast-print=omp.
#     * OpenMP compilation after that.
# * "EXE_S2S_PRT":
#   * Indicates an execution sub test suite and either:
#     * Source-to-source mode with -fopenacc-ast-print=omp.
#     * OpenMP compilation after that.
# * "EXE_TRAD":
#   * Indicates an execution sub test suite and traditional compilation.

# from the matched groups using a more sophisticated algorithm.
#
# TODO: Because we're using a function in a LIT substitution value, this depends
# on a small LIT modification in the processLine function in the
# applySubstitutions function in llvm/utils/lit/lit/TestRunner.py to accept that

# %if-exe-COND

# These substitutions are always defined, including in the "dump" and "print"
# sub test suites, but their expansions depend on the current sub test suite.
#
# COND values:
# * "host" indicates compilation only for host.
# * The omp_device_t spelling of an architecture-specific device type (e.g.,
#   "x86_64" or "nvptx64") indicates offload compilation only for that device
#   type.
#
# Behavior of %if-tgt-COND<TRUE|FALSE>:
# * Expands to TRUE if the condition indicated by COND is true, and expands to
#   FALSE otherwise.
# * COND="host" is true throughout the "dump", "print", and "host" sub test
#   suites.  Otherwise, COND is true throughout the architecture-specific sub
#   test suite it indicates.  COND is false otherwise.
# * TRUE and FALSE cannot include any character in the set "<>|".  As a
#   result, these substitutions cannot appear in each other's arguments.
# * Either TRUE or FALSE can be the empty string.
# * "|" cannot be omitted even if FALSE is the empty string.  Otherwise, it's
#   too easy to read any comma within TRUE as the delimiter.
# * These substitutions are designed to avoid syntactic ambiguity when:
#   * They appear within %acc-check-*{...} arguments.
#   * They appear within %data {...}.
#   * TRUE or FALSE contains commas (e.g., for delimiting FileCheck prefix
#     components).
#
# Behavior of %if-exe-COND:
# * This should be placed in front of any command line in a "RUN:" directive if
#   that command line should run only when the current sub test suite is the
#   exact execution ("exe") sub test suite indicated by COND.
# * The command line will thus always be skipped in "dump" and "print" sub test
#   suites.
# * The command line should not contain pipes as it will be placed in the
#   argument list of a ":" when it should be skipped.
# * A comment indicating whether the command is being run or skipped is
#   prepended to the command line using ":".
#
# If COND is not defined or any other syntax rules are not obeyed, LIT usually
# doesn't recognize the substitution and so doesn't expand it.  Usually the
# result is a shell error.

# %acc-check-exe[-cxx][-no-s2s]{...}
#
# Check execution with various compilation types and various offload
# configurations.  FileCheck is used to examine the combination of stdout and
# stderr from the application.  %acc-check-exe[-cxx]{...} is the same as
# %acc-check-exe[-cxx]-no-s2s{...} except that the latter does not check
# source-to-source compilation.
#
# The parameter list is:
# * clang-args: Additional command-line arguments to pass to all Clang commands.
# * exe-args: Command-line arguments to pass to the compiled application.
# * fc-args: Additional command-line arguments to pass to all FileCheck
#   commands.
# * fc-pres: A comma-separated list of FileCheck prefix components.
# * cmd-start: Code to insert before every shell command.  For example, it might
#   be ":" to suppress all commands (no pipes are used in commands so that this
#   works correctly).
#
# FileCheck prefixes are as follows:
# * The prefix base is "EXE".
# * There is one predefined set of prefix components: a set describing the
#   offload compilation configuration:
#   * "HOST": Offloading is disabled.
#   * "OFF": Offloading is enabled for some device type.
#   * "TGT-" followed by the uppercase version of the omp_device_t spelling of
#     an architecture-specific device type: Offloading is enabled for that
#     device type.
#   * "TGT-USE-STDIO": Target regions support stdio.  Always included if "HOST"
#     is included.
#   * "OFF-TGT-USE-STDIO": Included if "OFF" and "TGT-USE-STDIO" are included.
#     To reduce the number of FileCheck prefixes, TGT-USE-STDIO is never
#     combined with "HOST" or an architecture-specific "TGT-" prefix component.
#     Those are sufficient to determine whether target regions support stdio,
#     but "OFF-TGT-USE-STDIO" permits being more general.
# * WARNING: Be conservative about adding new prefix components.  They can
#   significantly increase test suite execution time.  For this reason, we do
#   not have "TGT-NOT-<ARCH>" prefixes.  One day hopefully FileCheck will
#   support directives like "CHECK-IF(!COND1 && !COND2):" so that the
#   inefficiency and complexity of prefix combinations and component negations
#   will no longer be necessary.
# * See the generic %acc-check-*{...} documentation at the beginning of this
#   file for details on how FileCheck prefixes are built.

#
# %acc-check-exe[-cxx]-compile{...} compiles using all compile types.
# %acc-check-exe[-cxx]-no-s2s-compile{...} compiles using traditional
# compilation mode only.  In either case, the parameter list is:

#
# %acc-check-exe[-cxx][-no-s2s]-run{...} runs the application for all compile

# %acc-check-exe[-cxx][-no-s2s]-compile-c{...}

# stages.  For example, this can permit compiling and linking multiple
# compilation units into the same executable.
#
# The %acc-check-exe[-cxx][-no-s2s]-compile-c{...} parameter list is:
# * base-name: The base name to use for this compilation unit.  Most
#   importantly, if the value is "foo", the object file name will be "foo.o".
#   The working directory is changed for each compilation type, so "foo.o" will
#   always resolve to the desired object file for every compilation type when it
#   is checked.
# * clang-args: Additional command-line arguments to pass to all Clang commands.
# * cmd-start: Code to insert before every shell command.
#
# The %acc-check-exe[-cxx][-no-s2s]-link{...} argument list is:
# * clang-args: Additional command-line arguments to pass to all Clang commands.
#   This is at least a series of object files.
# * cmd-start: Code to insert before every shell command.
