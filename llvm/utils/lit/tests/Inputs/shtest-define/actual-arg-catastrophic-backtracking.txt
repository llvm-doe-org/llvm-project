# Make sure two few arguments don't lead to catastrophic backtracking in
# python's regex engine.  This can occur because it's tempting to write the
# regex for an actual argument and its leading/trailing whitespace as
# '\s*(?P<param>...)\s*' where '...' is a regex that accepts any series of
# leading/trailing whitespace as well.
#
# No substitution expansion should actually occur because there are two few
# arguments.  White space is collapsed in CHECK directives here just because
# we're not using FileCheck's -strict-whitespace.
