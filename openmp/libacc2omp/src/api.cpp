/*****************************************************************************
 * Device management routines.
 *
 * Interpretation of acc_device_t enumerators:
 * - OpenACC 3.1 is unclear about the exact semantics of various acc_device_t
 *   enumerators.  Here, we generally describe the semantics we assume, which
 *   are mostly based on our experiments with nvc 20.11-0.  Within each
 *   routine's implementation below appear specific notes about the routine's
 *   handling of these semantics, including notes about cases where behavior
 *   does not match nvc in an attempt to follow our assumed semantics more
 *   consistently.
 * - Each enumerator refers to an ordered list of devices.  Some lists are
 *   mutually exclusive, but some are not.
 * - acc_device_none:
 *   - Refers to an empty list of devices.
 * - Architecture-specific enumerators
 *   - These are enumerators, such as acc_device_nvidia, that name a specific
 *     architecture.  Each refers to the list of all available non-host devices
 *     of the architecture it names.
 *   - Currently, these lists are always mutually exclusive.  It's conceivable
 *     that, in the future, more than one enumerator might logically describe a
 *     single device, but that will require some adjustments to our
 *     implementation of acc_device_default and acc_get_device_type, as noted
 *     below.
 * - acc_device_host:
 *   - Refers to a list containing one device, the host device.
 *   - The host device is logically distinct from any non-host device even if
 *     they are the same physical device and thus of the same architecture.
 *     Thus, the host device never appears in the list referred to by an
 *     architecture-specific enumerator.  For how this decision impacts
 *     acc_on_device, see the acc_on_device notes in Clang's OpenACC status
 *     document.
 * - acc_device_not_host:
 *   - Refers to the list of all non-host devices.
 *   - Ideally, the set of devices in this list is exactly the union of the sets
 *     of devices appearing in lists referred to by architecture-specific
 *     enumerators.
 *   - However, there might be times when an OpenMP runtime (including LLVM's)
 *     supports devices for which our acc_device_t doesn't yet have an
 *     architecture-specific enumerator, and then the list referred to by
 *     acc_device_not_host might have additional devices.  Hopefully that
 *     situation will always be resolved quickly, but we want to handle it
 *     gracefully until it is resolved.
 *   - Our experiments seem to show that, if all non-host devices are of the
 *     same architecture, nvc 20.11-0 handles acc_device_not_host the same as it
 *     would that architecture-specific enumerator.  So far, that agrees with
 *     our implementation.  However, we haven't found a system on which to build
 *     nvc for multiple non-host device architectures, so we're not sure how to
 *     determine if nvc perhaps implements acc_device_not_host as just the
 *     current device's architecture-specific enumerator when the current device
 *     is not host and as acc_device_none when it is.
 * - The current device type vs. the current device:
 *   - In OpenACC 3.1's model, the current device type is represented by
 *     acc-current-device-type-var (which is accessed by acc_get_device_type),
 *     and the current device is represented by the combination of
 *     acc-current-device-type-var and acc-current-device-num-var.
 *   - In this implementation, the current device type is either
 *     acc_device_host, acc_device_not_host, or an architecture-specific
 *     enumerator.  Regardless, the referenced list includes the current device.
 *   - The current device type is acc_device_not_host only when the current
 *     device is a non-host device that cannot yet be represented by an
 *     architecture-specific enumerator.
 *   - If the environment or application has not selected a current device type,
 *     the implementation selects it based on device availability and
 *     compilation options.  For example, currently,
 *     -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda,x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu will
 *     usually cause acc_device_nvidia to be the initial current device type.
 *   - If the environment or application has not selected a current device, the
 *     implementation selects one of the current device type.
 *   - Because the lists referred to by architecture-specific enumerators are
 *     always mutually exclusive for now, after the current device has been
 *     selected, the current device type can be determined uniquely from it.  If
 *     that mutually exclusive property doesn't remain true in the future, the
 *     current device type will need to be recorded separately from the current
 *     device in order for acc_device_default and acc_get_device_type to be
 *     implemented correctly.
 * - acc_device_default:
 *   - Refers to the list of all devices of the current device type.
 *   - The best hint OpenACC 3.1 gives for acc_device_default semantics is in
 *     sec. 3.1 "Runtime Library Definitions", L2976-2978: "The value
 *     acc_device_default will never be returned by any function; its use as an
 *     argument will tell the runtime library to use the default device type for
 *     that implementation."  Unfortunately, this is vague and could be
 *     interpreted as the device type an implementation chooses when the current
 *     device type has not otherwise been set.  Deciding that acc_device_default
 *     equals the current device type better matches the behavior we have
 *     observed in our experiments with nvc.
 * - acc_device_current:
 *   - Refers to a list containing one device, the current device.
 *   - The best hint OpenACC 3.1 gives for acc_device_current semantics is in
 *     sec. 3.2.6 "acc_get_property", L3091-3093: "If dev_type has the value
 *     acc_device_current, then dev_num is ignored and the value of the property
 *     for the current device is returned."  As described below, we extend this
 *     concept of ignoring the specified dev_num to acc_set_device_num.
 *
 * TODO: We haven't implemented ACC_DEVICE_NUM and ACC_DEVICE_TYPE yet.  Under
 * nvc 20.11-0, they have interesting effects.  ACC_DEVICE_NUM seems to
 * permanently set the device number that will be chosen when calling
 * acc_set_device_type for that initial current device's type.  ACC_DEVICE_TYPE
 * seems to make it impossible to choose acc_device_host (or perhaps any other
 * non-host device type, but we don't have a system where we know how to try
 * that).

/*****************************************************************************
 * Data and memory management routines.
 *
 * Handling of null pointers:
 * - The behavior is often not clearly specified in OpenACC 3.1.
 * - We attempt to follow a concept discussed by the OpenACC technical
 *   committee: a null pointer is considered always present.  Specifically, we
 *   assume the behavior is as if there is an "acc data" enclosing the entire
 *   program that maps a host null pointer to a device null pointer so that the
 *   structured reference count is always non-zero.  Because a null pointer
 *   doesn't actually point to data, we also assume that the number of bytes
 *   specified to a routine is ignored and that any update requested for a null
 *   pointer does nothing.
 * - We document each routine's specific handling of null pointers in more
 *   detail below and relate it to this concept where applicable.
 *
 * Handling of bytes=0:
 * - The behavior is usually not clearly specified in OpenACC 3.1.
 * - We attempt to mimc nvc 20.9-0 as much as possible:
 *   - Except for acc_is_present, for all routines that accept a bytes argument,
 *     do nothing other than returning a null pointer where the return type is
 *     void*.
 *   - For acc_is_present, handle bytes=0 like bytes=1.  This behavior follows
 *     OpenACC 3.1.
 *   - These behaviors seem to, at least partially, address the second potential
 *     use case below.
 * - Potential use cases:
 *   - bytes=0 for data of size > 0:
 *     - This is part of a more general use case of specifying bytes<N to
 *       operate on data of size N>0 when it is not convenient to determine the
 *       exact value of N at the routine's call site.  That is, this use case
 *       relies on N already stored in the present table.
 *     - The current behavior of enter/exit-data-like routines does not support
 *       this use case for bytes=0 though it does for bytes>0: it does not
 *       adjust dynamic reference counts and perform any consequent deletions or
 *       data transfers.  It does nothing.
 *     - This use case does not include other data and memory management
 *       routines, which operate on exactly the specified bytes not on N bytes.
 *   - bytes=0 for data of size 0:
 *     - That is, imagine an application that maps N>=0 bytes to the device and
 *       then calls various data and memory management routines for a subset,
 *       M<=N.  Imagine we want the application to gracefully handle (not fail
 *       for) the cases of M=0 and N=0.
 *     - To support the M=0 but N>0 case, it usually sufficient for acc_malloc,
 *       enter/exit-data-like routines, update routines, acc_map_data, and
 *       memcpy routines to do nothing when bytes=0: the specified address is
 *       present but operations on the subset M become no-ops.  acc_deviceptr,
 *       acc_hostptr, and acc_is_present indicate presence for the base address
 *       of the M bytes as when M>0.
 *     - The same is true for the M=N=0 case except that acc_deviceptr,
 *       acc_hostptr, and acc_is_present now indicate absence for the base
 *       address.  Whether that's desirable may be application-dependent.  It
 *       might be argued that application code that would invoke those for the M
 *       bytes would often be naturally skipped when M=0 (for example, in a loop
 *       with M iterations).
 * - Alternative behaviors:
 *   - Modify bytes=0 behavior for consistency with bytes>0 behavior to better
 *     support the above use cases and so that these routines agree with
 *     acc_deviceptr, acc_hostptr, and acc_is_present about when a (data_arg, 0)
 *     pair is considered present:
 *     - Modify acc_malloc: return a unique device address that can be passed to
 *       acc_map_data with bytes=0.
 *     - Modify enter-data-like routines and acc_map_data when address is not
 *       already present: create a present table entry for the address with size
 *       0.  As for bytes>0, enter-data-like routines should map a unique device
 *       address, and acc_map_data behavior should be undefined if the specified
 *       device address is not unique.  Unique device addresses are for the sake
 *       of acc_deviceptr and acc_hostptr.
 *     - Modify enter/exit-data-like and acc_map_data routines when address is
 *       already present: behave like the bytes>0 case.  That is,
 *       enter/exit-data-like routines should adjust the dynamic reference count
 *       and perform any consequent deletions or data transfers.  acc_map_data
 *       should produce a runtime error.
 *     - Modify update routines: check for presence even though bytes=0.  This
 *       seems fine if present table entries can have size 0.  Even so, the
 *       check could be viewed as redundant given that no bytes will actually
 *       by transferred.
 *     - One use case this alternative does not address: an accidental attempt
 *       to map two consecutive memory ranges with the same starting address
 *       because the size of the first range has fallen to zero.  This case
 *       would have to be handled specially in the application to avoid runtime
 *       errors or undefined behavior.  Such undefined behavior could occur when
 *       the ranges are consecutive only on the device side when, for example,
 *       acc_malloc is being used for memory pooling.
 *     - acc_is_present, for example, would no longer have identical behavior
 *       for bytes=0 and bytes=1.  This at least represents a subtle change from
 *       previous behavior.
 *   - Produce runtime errors:
 *     - The current bytes=0 behavior may be confusing due to inconsistencies
 *       with the bytes>0 behavior.
 *     - The previous alternative behavior to avoid that confusion has subtle
 *       differences in reference counting from nvc's current behavior and
 *       could thus lead to memory errors that are difficult to debug in
 *       existing applications.  Moreover, runtime errors or undefined behavior
 *       may still occur for the bytes=0 case but not the bytes>0 when
 *       attempting to map consecutive memory ranges.
 *     - Always producing a runtime error for bytes=0 would avoid all these
 *       problems.  It might be the best option if the above use cases are
 *       not worthwhile to support.
 * - These alternative behaviors need to be discussed with the OpenACC
 *   technical committee.

 * - nvc 20.9-0 doesn't yet implement acc_memcpy_d2d.
 * Handling pointers referring to the same memory:
 * - In the case of acc_memcpy_device, if the pointers are the same, do nothing.
 * - In the case of the other routines, if both pointers refer to shared memory
 *   and are the same, do nothing.
 * - Additionally in the case of acc_memcpy_d2d, if the devices are the same
 *   and the pointers are the same, do nothing, even if the data pointed to is
 *   inaccessible (checking accessibility isn't cheap, so don't do it just to
 *   protect a no-op).
 * - OpenACC 3.1 is unclear about the behavior in this case but does have text
 *   that was likely misworded but intended to specify the above behavior for

 *   "If both arrays are in shared memory, then no action is taken."
 * - Text to specify the above behavior in OpenACC has already been proposed:
 *   - It's not meant simply as a clarification that behavior is not left
 *     undefined as for, for example, C99's memcpy.  It's meant as an
 *     optimization for shared memory, exactly as specified for OpenACC data
 *     clauses and the enter/exit-data-like routines and update routines.
 *   - However, it's also extended to copies within a single device's memory,
 *     using either acc_memcpy_device or acc_memcpy_d2d.  Because this
 *     optimization isn't part of the shared memory optimizations, it might be
 *     worthwhile for the OpenACC rationale doc to explain all this.
 * - OpenMP 5.1 could be read to mean this case is well defined for
 *   omp_target_memcpy, but it doesn't specifically discuss overlapping regions,
 *   so we assume this case wasn't actually considered.  Moreover, LLVM's
 *   implementation of omp_target_memcpy does not check for this case and
 *   sometimes calls memcpy, for which this case has undefined behavior due to
 *   C99's restrict qualifier.  Thus, we must check here.  TODO: If OpenMP
 *   clarifies omp_target_memcpy's behavior for this case as effectively a
 *   no-op, then we can eliminate our checks in most cases.
