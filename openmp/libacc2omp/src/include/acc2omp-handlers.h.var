/*
 * acc2omp-handlers.h -- Interface for functions that are implemented in
 * libacc2omp and that must be called by the OpenMP runtime for correct OpenACC
 * handling of certain OpenMP runtime events.
 *
 * Because libacc2omp isn't necessarily linked when OpenACC support isn't
 * desired, the OpenMP runtime uses a dlsym-like implementation to find the
 * functions in this interface, so this header provides typedefs for them rather
 * than prototypes.
 *
 * (For a discussion of OpenMP runtime entry points that libacc2omp must call,
 * see acc2omp-backend.h.)

/// Type for \c acc2omp_set_omp_default_device, which handles initial selection
/// of the OpenACC current device based on, for example, the environment
/// variables \c ACC_DEVICE_TYPE and \c ACC_DEVICE_NUM.
///
/// The OpenMP runtime should call \c acc2omp_set_omp_default_device during
/// runtime initialization.  At that point, the OpenMP runtime must be in a
/// state where \c acc2omp_set_omp_default_device can successfully:
/// - Examine the full OpenMP device list (e.g., \c omp_get_num_devices and
///   \c omp_get_device_of_type).
/// - Examine and later alter the OpenMP default device (e.g.,
///   \c omp_get_default_device, \c omp_get_device_type, and
///   \c omp_set_default_device).  The OpenMP default device's type is used
///   when \c ACC_DEVICE_NUM is specified without \c ACC_DEVICE_TYPE.
/// - Report a fatal runtime error for invalid OpenACC device types or numbers
///   (e.g., \c acc2omp_fatal).
///
/// LLVM's OpenMP runtime currently chooses to skip calling
/// \c acc2omp_set_omp_default_device when:
/// - The \c OMP_DEFAULT_DEVICE environment variable is set.  In this way,
///   OpenMP mechanisms are treated as lower-level mechanisms that override
///   OpenACC mechanisms.
/// - The runtime is never entered from the application's OpenACC code.  That
///   is, simply compiling with -fopenacc isn't sufficient to trigger checking
///   of OpenACC environment variables at run time.  The application must
///   actually execute OpenACC code.

/// Type for \c acc2omp_ompt_start_tool, which handles OpenACC Profiling
/// Interface callback registration.
///
/// \c acc2omp_ompt_start_tool is meant to be called by OMPT's
/// \c ompt_start_tool and has the same function type.
/// \c acc2omp_ompt_start_tool calls the various \c acc_register_library
/// functions it finds linked or listed in the environment variable
/// \c ACC_PROFLIB and then returns a result appropriate for the calling
/// \c omp_start_tool to return.  The result is \c NULL if no
/// \c acc_register_library registered any callbacks.  That way, a calling
/// \c ompt_start_tool can determine whether it's necessary to enable OMPT
/// support, look for another \c ompt_start_tool, etc.
///
/// Normally, the calling \c ompt_start_tool is the one defined in LLVM's
/// OpenMP runtime.  It has the \c weak attribute, so it and thus all
/// \c acc_register_library definitions might be ignored if another
/// \c ompt_start_tool is linked.  Otherwise, it indeed calls
/// \c acc2omp_ompt_start_tool and then, if the result is \c NULL, uses a
/// dlsym-like implementation to search for another \c ompt_start_tool.
///
/// If the user wants to ensure his \c acc_register_library functions are
/// called, perhaps when using a different OpenMP runtime that doesn't call
/// \c acc2omp_ompt_start_tool, he can define:
///
/// \code
/// ompt_start_tool_result_t *ompt_start_tool(unsigned int omp_version,
///                                           const char *runtime_version) {
///   return acc2omp_ompt_start_tool(omp_version, runtime_version);
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// However, to avoid collisions between this \c ompt_start_tool and others, the
/// user should consider whether it's better to build this \c ompt_start_tool as
/// part of a different library than his libacc2omp backend, especially if his
/// libacc2omp backend is compiled as part of his OpenMP runtime.
///
/// TODO: It might be convenient for LLVM to provide a library with just that
/// definition, and the user could link it only when desired.
